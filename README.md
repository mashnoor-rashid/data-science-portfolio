# Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Python notebooks. 

## Datasets 
All datasets used in the notebooks and analyses are saved in a public Google Cloud storage [bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/mashnoor-data-science-portfolio).  

## Note on viewing visuals in notebooks  
Some visuals in the notebooks were created with plotly library. I notice that these are not viewable once uploaded to Github. For now please open Google Collobatory link at the top of the notebook to view visuals created with Plotly. Will upload fix to this soon.
